                    <!--					Through Dealflow we broker deals to earn cash commissions and equity, for opening our network to your startup. Dealflow network is made up of people we have earned during our journey expressed through out our web pages and blogs. The people we know are the people your business may need, to capitalise and capitalise big.
<br><br>
Dealflow is your team, you train to work on your investment facilitation, over your lifetime of such raises. So simply that they bring to you the right man/men/woman/women with money. Then it is upto to convert for they want to just talk to the horse, from his own mouth. During this process we keep hustling from your side of the table to help you receive investment to the point of money reaching your bank account. Only after this do we consider our job done.
We hustle with you to facilitate investment in your startup. If the deal goes through, we take minimum upto 10% commission and some equity.
Why ? Because we make matches between investors and startups that add value in each other far beyond money. However, most importantly, we are getting you the most important immediate resource your business needs. Money. When Preseed introduces you, it matters. We have worked very hard to have now built an extraordinary network of those with money and will to aid an early stage startup. We have prepared most in our network to have that will, to support you with their time and money. We are charging you for that hard work of ours if it brings investment to you.
<br><br>
Before you proceed to dialogue with those we introduce you to, accept words written in <this> contract. The precise equity and commission amounts will be discussed with Amit on Amit.preseed@gmail.com. Rest is indicated on the above link.
<br><br>
If the equity you offer us is 15% or more in advance, you get entitled to receive the service mentioned on <a href="https://preseed.in" target="_blank">www.preseed.in</a> for a lifetime.
Anyway, the more equity and wealth we foresee we can earn from you, will be directly proportional to how much of an effort we put into helping you raise money. We can go all in to serve you in all mentioned on <a href="https://preseed.in" target="_blank">www.preseed.in.</a> The choice is yours. None of what we do is charity. To the contrary, we are expensive, because, we recognise what we are bringing to your table — money, is key to your growth here on.
<br><br>
Our commissions rates are fixed on actual investment achieved every single time you receive investment from anyone we introduce you to or if you receive investments from any of the associates of whoever we introduced you to, Received now or/and later. Whenever,
The final valuations agreed upon will be determined between you and the investor. We will merely facilitate that conversation.
<br><br>
The more equity you offer us, the better we are able to use our advisor network to extend our advisory to you.
<br><br>
Step 0 — Email us at your funding requirements, projected disbursement of funds broadly, expected post money valuation and Slide Deck. Preseed.in will contact you through Amit.preseed@gmail.com, at its own will and time. Please ensure, your email has no more than 3 lines apart from the above mentioned. If you don’t have these documents, we will charge you Rs. 1 Lakh to make these for you, and to engage with you over phone calls, for if you hafve these documents to our satisfaction, we won’t need to engage over phone calls. Then we will simply be
<br><br>
Step 1 — Thereafter, proceed to sign <this> enforceable contract which states the commission and equity we take for facilitating investment.
<br><br>
Step 2 — Once the contract is signed, we organise introductions for you that can solve your current challenge of money. You give us whatever is committed to us by you, once you have accepted any deal with any investor we brought in.
<br><br>
Step 3 — Every time you need money or connections, you can count on us. Now, we will stay in touch with you, and will keep pointing you to the right potential investors along the way for further rounds too. We will connect you with whoever we think can mean value to your business, either by sweat, mind or money. It is networking is a consistent part of running your business. It is this part, we bring to your table. Our motivation to do this is what we get offered by you.
<br><br>
Note -: No matter who we connect you to, before you shake a hand with them, you have to take our approval. Without that approval if you proceed to accept any direct or indirect business benefit from anyone from our network of people, we will consider it a breach. In most cases, we connect you to various entities along our journey together and if the weight of what it can open for you is greater than the stake we have in your company, we renegotiate with you before you get our approval.
<br><br>
Dealflow associates are independent humans who closely work with Preseed startups in brokering all kind of deals for startups. They may have their own terms and conditions which they will send to you themselves. If we connect you two, its over to you both. 
<br><br>
We have already covered this in our writings below in greater detail. We inspire, co-build and educate you on business values we believe in. Most of it is counter cultured. But that is what works in these extraordinary ‘internet’ times of FREE information and FREE tools' that have led to more noise than information of value.
<br><br>
1. Mentorship/Advise — Our advise will lead you to decipher the startup plan, its phases and over all strategies so crisp and simple that it actually STARTS bootstrapped and conducts itself in smarter and contemporary ways. We continue to function as advisors through out the course of the business so long as you feel our need.
<br><br>
2. Scale up Connections — These connections are thoughtfully created potential tie ups that make the process of building a great company faster, more efficient, more cost effective and more scalable. We create a structure around you that leaves you more time to focus on what is most critical to your business so that you do what is most important and others do everything else. These tie ups could be infrastructural tie ups, operational tie ups, process tie ups, technology tieups, human resource tie ups or anyother tie up that can help grow the startup.
<br><br>
3. Vendors — We connect you to the vendors for various executions. These vendors are those vendors we have identified as most cost effective vendors over our experience of the last 5 years.
<br><br>
4. Investments — We put you through the right potential investors for your startup and in exceptionally good cases we will get you the investments too.
<br><br>
5. We work with you on anything that we think requires our attention towards chasing a common goal with you.

We hope you understand that most ideas that people write to us about are redefined by us, sometimes even completely changed. (Obviously in the interest of the business). -->

                    For startups:<br><br>
                    Through Dealflow we broker deals to earn cash commissions and equity, for opening our network to
                    your startup.<br><br>

                    Dealflow network is made up of people we have earned during our journey expressed throughout our web
                    pages and blogs. The people we know are the people your business may need, to capitalise and
                    capitalise big.<br><br>

                    Dealflow is your team, you train to work on your investment facilitation, over your lifetime of such
                    fund raises. So simply that they bring to you the right man/men/woman/women with money. Then it is
                    upto to you to convert for they want to just talk to the horse, from his own mouth. During this
                    process we keep hustling from your side of the table to help you receive investment to the point of
                    money reaching your bank account. Only after this do we consider our job done. <br><br><br>

                    The startups should think they are doing incredible hand shakes and giving equities for these
                    handshakes instead. Period. This is the best way of building a business when all handshakes are
                    impactful and aligned. While in the process the founders get money perhaps worth exactly equal to
                    the amount they were originally seeking from us, to extend their own sustenance run way in exchange
                    for equity to those that helped them in getting that money, including us.<br><br>

                    <span style="display: block; text-align: center;">“Investors, as long as the startups have enough
                      money from you for their day to day life at ease for 1 year, they will make their dream happen. We
                      look for this quality/ingredient in the founder’s specifically”.</span><br><br>
                    For investors:<br>
                    As a matter of policy Preseed values a startup at a <span style="font-weight: bold;">post Preseed
                      handshake</span> stage, at a minimum of 1 crore before it brings it forward for investment to the
                    potential investor.<br><br>
                    The investors are requested to also bet on the fact that what Preseed is brining to them as a
                    dealflow, once was a mere set of humans with no startup in hand worthy enough, and it was at this
                    time that Preseed held their hand to add its own input into that startup for years, from when
                    founders were early 20 year old kids to now — when they are sitting in front of you.<br><br>
                    To say the least, anything lower in valuation is exploitation of Preseed/Nishchal, their network,
                    their do good hippie spirit and their modern collective. Startup assets which Preseed develops
                    relationships with over years are very very valuable, “because my people are rare and their
                    entrepreneurial foundations are strong and deep, a big part of the reason the startup will be
                    successful is that it has us with them over a deal in good faith and words a couple of years ago and
                    the startup decided to keep their word to us forever.<br><br>
                    Anything I bring to you, no matter what you can do to it, never value it at less than 1 crore. I
                    will not be interested in bringing anything to you if that be the case. It’s a matter of policy at
                    Preseed and generally in all startup friendly logics in the world, that we accept a valuation of at
                    least 1 crore. Anything of less value is not worth anyone of ours time. You need to on the side
                    agree with me that cafe de Math is worth 1 crore. If yes, then you are genuine in your valuations.
                    If we don’t get this right among you and I, a lot between us may be missed.<br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">No small talks of collateral, security, safety etc.</span> please.
                    If you are looking for that, you are at the wrong place. This is about status quo changing
                    possibilities that go to values of billions someday. Our investor friend has simply gotta be
                    prepared to bear the cost of owning the proposed equity. Simple business math  -  they pay a cost to
                    own some asset, in this case, not a piece of land, but a piece of a large possibility. High risk,
                    sky high rewards. <br><br>
                    Think of the deal with our portfolio startup, like this:<br><br>
                    Value any startup I bring such that, if you were to own all of it, you were willing to pay 1 crore
                    of upfront cost for 100% of it. Because the value of what I am bringing to you is greater than the
                    possession of a 1 crore plot.<br><br>
                    You are buying a piece of a larger piece of a real estate plot, so that it gives you gains in the
                    future. This piece of land would at least be worth Rs. 1 crore. How do you buy a piece of plot less
                    than that in a prime market of your city? You don't. So is the reason that you can't buy the startup
                    we will be bringing to you at less than that value.<br><br>
                    If you don't value the asset we bring to you at atleast that price in spite of the fact that Preseed
                    is a partner in that asset, then you are undervaluing Preseed.<br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">This minimum value of 1 crore per asset as MVP and founding team is
                      the premise of our relationship.</span> <br><br>
                    <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Questions like, what happens if your money drowns,
                      must be avoided please. </span><br><br><br>

                    For startups:<br><br><br><br>



                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Matches made in heaven</span> - If the deal goes through, we take a
                    minimum upto 10% commission and some equity. Why ? Because we make matches between investors and
                    startups that add value in each other far beyond money. However, most importantly, we are getting
                    you the most important immediate resource your business needs. Money. When Preseed introduces you,
                    it matters. We have worked very hard to have now built an extraordinary network of those with money
                    and will to aid an early stage startup. We have prepared most in our network to have that will, to
                    support you with their time and money. We are charging you for that hard work of ours if it brings
                    investment to you.<br><br>

                    Before you proceed to dialogue with those we introduce you to, accept words written in contract with
                    the precise equity and commission amounts.<br><br>

                    <span style="display: block; text-align: center;">
                      <b>Equity offer and service</b> - If the equity you offer us is 15% or more in advance, you get
                      entitled to receive the service mentioned on Preseed Yoga (mentioned on nishchal.preseed.in, for a
                      lifetime. Anyway, the more equity and wealth we foresee we can earn from/thorugh you or your
                      cooperation, will be directly proportional to how much of an effort we put into helping you raise
                      money. The choice is yours. We are expensive, because, we recognise what we are bringing to your
                      table — money, is key to your growth here on.<br><br>

                      Our commissions rates are fixed on actual investment achieved every single time you receive
                      investment from anyone we introduce you to or if you receive investments from any of the
                      associates of whoever we introduced you to, Received now or/and later. Whenever, The final
                      valuations agreed upon will be determined between you and the investor. We will merely facilitate
                      that conversation.<br><br>

                      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The more equity you offer us, the better we are able to use our
                        advisor network to extend our advisory to you.<br><br>

                        Note - our equity gets bought too on a pro rata basis at the time of the deal with the investor.
                        <br><br>

                        Plus<br><br><br>

                        The more we are able to gain out of this fee, the stronger we serve our portfolio startup. It is
                        in the startup’s interest that we make good money in this process so we serve the startups with
                        all our intentions and sweat, out of bounds.
                        Sometimes we charge commission from the investor too. Be clear please that Preseed negotiates
                        the deal to bring investor the agreed upon % at the instance of his first payment to Preseed as
                        consulting fee. If Preseed makes any gain on it, it belongs to Preseed, it should not be a
                        matter of concern to either the startup or the investor. For both startup and the investor got
                        what they wanted.</span>
                    </span><br><br><br>


                    The founder should care about just one thing, that they may get money to live 1 more year at ease or
                    so, one day, and it is for that ease that they are sharing equity with someone Preseed is bringing
                    on board.<br><br>
                    The bottom line is, the founder gets the money he seeked personally, as if his own shares got
                    bought.

            <p style="font-family:corbert;font-size:20px;text-align:justify"> On a journey to inspiring a bunch of very
              talented people to joining him on his mission to empower the entrepreneurs through very thoughtful ideas
              at <a href="http://www.preseed.in" target="_blank">Preseed</a>, Nishchal has garnered a very original
              perspective on business building from bottom up. The ingredients he has built Preseed so far on have been
              anything but money. Hence, his ability to bootstrap is second to perhaps a very few. His ability to
              inspire is also second to a very few out there. Apart from that being an advantage to our portfolio
              companies in building their teams, his eye for design and novelty make him an incredibly good critique to
              our portfolio startups

              <br><br>

              Nishchal has 100s of vendors who have double the motivation to serve you due to the relationship they
              enjoy with him. These vendors acknowledge that they are achieving greater success, through us, beyond just
              your project, and that is why we are a key source to their motivation. What does this mean? It means, that
              our word matters to them. <br> <br>

              Nishchal has also served clients in ERP deployment for a subsidiary of Rs. 500 crore plus traditional
              business group in Delhi called BK Group to branding for Libra Mattresses. You may read Nishchal's Linkedin
              recommendations too. <br> <br>
              This is what Nishchal can do with his vendors for you with his network  -  <br> <br>
              1. With us you could lay a foundation for an idea and scale it up with far lower costs than you may
              imagine. (This can be particularly usefull if tou are a son or a daughter of the owner of a large
              company) - To channel your resources better, we just need one man or a woman from your team to train him
              or her closely to lead your company soon. The best way to do this is to enable them to start one of their
              own ideas to get their hands dirty upon as an entrepreneur. Train them prematurely, without the cushion of
              your luxury. Let them taste that sweat. Then let them come back in and make that impact. <br> <br>
              2. Along with that almost invariably whatever we attempt from within the scope of your resources will be
              something unique in its offering. <br> <br>
              3. You can raise any business concern with us. 
              Half of your business is about having the right kind of openings and network. Our prime motive through above words is to let you know that we will service/strengthen our own portfolio companies when those companies become sizeable.

      liberal minds trying to do our thing in harmony with another. Let’s just say, Preseed, as an organization, is
      designed such that we find harmony in each other by way of who we are anyway. Preseed brings the extraordinary
      minds and hence, the extraordinary creativity and hustle to the table on anything it touches upon.
